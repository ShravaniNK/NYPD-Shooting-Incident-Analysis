## Project Overview
   This project analyzes publicly available NYPD Shooting Incident Data to identify temporal, geographic, and demographic patterns in gun violence. 
   The project emphasizes data quality, reproducibility, and clear communication, recognizing the sensitive and community-centered nature of violence prevention work.

## Objectives
  Analyze gun violence trends over time to identify periods of elevated risk
  Identify geographic concentrations of shootings to support targeted prevention efforts
  Examine demographic and situational patterns to inform community-centered interventions
  Translate analytical findings into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders
  Demonstrate an end-to-end analytical workflow suitable for nonprofit program evaluation

## Dataset
Source: NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Open Data NYC)
### Content Includes:
    Date and time of shooting
    Location (borough, precinct, latitude/longitude)
    Victim demographics (age group, sex, race)
    Injury or fatality outcome

All data cleaning and transformations were performed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility.

## Methods & Tools
### Data Cleaning & Validation:
    Handled missing values, standardized date/time fields, validated geographic fields

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Trend analysis, distribution analysis, and comparative breakdowns

### Visualization:
    ggplot2 for clear, publication-ready charts

### Reproducibility:
    Modular R scripts with documented steps and assumptions

## Key Insights
The analysis reveals clear temporal patterns, geographic clustering, and demographic disparities in gun violence incidents—highlighting opportunities for targeted, evidence-based prevention strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.
### These findings demonstrate how structured data analysis can support:
    Strategic allocation of community resources
    Timing and location of intervention programs
    Ongoing program evaluation and impact measurement
